# H1 Describe Distributed Workflow
*These changes to the group worflow is define week2 and will be implemented from next week*

**Public GitHub-repository, with the following setup:**
- MIT-license. 
- .gitignore - for filtering OS and IDE specific files.
- A readme.md - with centralized information on versions and future releases, following the course structure. 
- We will implement GitHub actions for continuous integration and continuous delivery automating our build, test, and deployment pipelines.


**TDB branching model**: 
Integrating changes to a shared short-lived development-branch, that is allways in a releasable state. 
This branch is merged to the main branch, when a weeks assignment/issues have been solved. 
Submitting code every day will ensure that the team is forced to integrate changes fast.
We will often collaborate on a single local branch in collaboration via a screenshare or codeshare, but this practice keeps us flexible if needing to split the team to solve larger tasks.

**Distributed development workflow:** Centralized Workflow.
No rebasing and squasing. 

**Definition Of Done** 
- No logical errors. 
- Everything works, but minor UI is okay. 
- It must run with no issue to functionality. *Like a GET- method must work. All tests should pass.* 
- pull requests is accepted.

*This is a contributiuon: Task (assigment) -> Issue -> Coding -> pull request.*

Everyone can review, but a least two have to accept a pull request.
