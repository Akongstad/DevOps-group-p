# Service Level Agreement

Our Monthly Uptime Percentage (hereafter abbreviated as MUP) 
describes the percentage of time where the server responds
to requests

| Covered Service | MUP  |
|-----------------|------|
| MiniTwitAPI     | 98%  |

if Group O does not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each metrics, 
such as the MUP, as described in this SLA, the Customer can send an request or complaint formulated 
as described below (see Issue Formulation) in a Github Issue.

## Definitions

The following definitions apply to this SLA:

**Back-off requirements:** When an error occurs on a request, wait 15 seconds for each failed request.

**Response time-frame:** the response time the Customer can expect on complaints is as followed:

| Day      | Time |
|----------|------|
| Mon-Thur | 24h  |
| Fri-Sun  | 72h  |

The response time may vary, however the Customer should receive

***NOTE:*** The days are excluding Danish holidays.

## Complaint Formulation
If the Customer wants to state a complaint, or the service is not satisfactory, 
the Customer can write a complaint to Group O through a Github issue.
The following describes how the issue should be formulated:

**Title:** *What is the main issue? Short and precise - e.g. Register seemingly not working*
**Description:** *What is the issue? details provided on the given problem.
What caused the issue?*  
*If given any error codes provide these here as well.
Optionally, screenshots of the given issue if the Customer finds this necessary can be included.*

## Exclusions:
This SLA does not apply to (a) any Alpha or Beta services; (b) errors caused by factors outside of Group O’s reasonable control e.g. Client hardware or software (can be both); (c) Errors caused by the Customer not adhering to the documentation, e.g. invaild requests or unauthorized use of the Service.
